  "bio": "As a Continuous Improvement Engineer, I bring practical experience in lean manufacturing, PFMEA development, process design, and assembly-line optimization. I’ve used AutoCAD and shop-floor data to redesign workstations and layouts, reducing cycle times and improving balance across lines. I also develop standard work, training materials, and visual controls that reduce defects and improve operator consistency. My goal is to scale production reliably while maintaining safety and quality.",
